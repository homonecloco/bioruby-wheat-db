	<h3>Welcome to the <em>in silico</em> wheat Target Induced Local Lesions In Genome (TILLING) website</h3>
	</div>
	<br/>
	<p>
	This resource consists of TILLING populations developed in tetraploid durum wheat cv 'Kronos' and hexaploid bread wheat cv 'Cadenza' as part of a joint project between the University of California Davis, Rothamsted Research, The Earlham Institute, and John Innes Centre.
	</p>

	<p>
	We have re-sequenced the exome of 1,535 Kronos and 1,200 Cadenza mutants using Illumina next-generation sequencing, aligned this raw data to the IWGSC Chinese Spring chromosome arm survey sequence, identified mutations, and predicted their effects based on the protein annotation available at Ensembl Plants.

 		Notice
 	</h4>
 	<p>
 		The mutations included in this database (www.wheat-tilling.com) were part of the original <a href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1619268114">Krasileva et al 2017</a>  study in which we defined mutations based on the IWGSC Chromosome Survey Sequence (CSS) gene models. These gene models have now been superseded by the IWGSC RefSeqv1.1 gene models (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar7191">IWGSC 2018</a>) which are a significant improvement over the CSS gene models (For more information on the comparisons see <a href="http://www.wheat-training.com">www.wheat-training.com</a>). The mutant exome sequence data has now been remapped to the IWGSC RefSeqv1.1 gene models and is available through <a href="http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Info/Index">EnsemblPlants</a>  
 	</p>
 	<p>
 		We strongly encourage users to access the mutant data through EnsemblPlants using either a <a href="http://plants.ensembl.org/Triticum_aestivum/Tools/Blast">blast search </a> or with the IWGSC RefSeqv1.1 gene model name. The EMS data can be found on the left hand side panel which reads “Variant table” or “Variant image” (see <a href="http://www.wheat-training.com/wp-content/uploads/TILLING/pdfs/Selecting-TILLING-mutants.pdf">this document</a> for more details). We have maintained this website as legacy data. If you have any queries please do not hesitate to contact  <a href="mailto:Cristobal.Uauy@jic.ac.uk">Cristobal Uauy</a>
